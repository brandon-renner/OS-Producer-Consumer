# OS-Producer-Consumer
#
# Not Done: 
# fix programs, add examples, add documentation file
#
# This program aims to solve the Producer-Consumer Problem 
# with the specifications set by the assignment for the 
# Operating Systems class
#
# these programs are written in the C-language, and were 
# developed on a Linux environment to be run with the 
# use of threads. To run this code, use the following 
# commands in sequence:
#
# $ gcc producer.c -pthread -lrt -o producer
# $ gcc consumer.c -pthread -lrt -o consumer
# $ ./producer & ./consumer &
#
# this project does not require any user inpiuts, and 
# should run in an infinite loop once beeing run together,
# successfully acting as parallel producer and consumer 
# functions

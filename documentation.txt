The first step of this project was around the design of two, independent algorithms that would
act as the producer and consumer functionalities. This step was fairly simple, as not only is 
this kind of implementation not difficult but this was a subject we studied extensively in class
and as such was still very fresh in my mind. The only real part of note here was the fact that the 
initial implementation I created was in c++, and was translated to c for more consisntent implementation
as the assignment progressed.

The next step of this assignment was actually implementing and creating the code needed to define shared memory
for these processes. For that, I used the implementation and documentation provided my the instructor
specifically for this project, utilizing shm_open and mmap. This was the particular reason why c was used 
rather than c++, as the examples in this documentation focused around c, and thus should make translation
easier between my purpose and that in the provided resource.

After implementing this code and correcting compile-time issues, problems arose with the run-time functionality
of this shared memory aswell. The current problem lies with permission acceptances, with it being denied for
some reason. Email has been sent to Professor, awaiting response.
